			"Why is y = (x - 3)² to the RIGHT of y = x²? There's a lot of different ways to explain this, but the way I prefer to explain it doesn't seem all that common on the internet. In my entry for SoME3, I provide a explanation that revolves around the relationship between a pre-transformation point and a post-transformation point. I then show how you could use this thinking to tackle two standard types of function transformation math problems.",

Using Laplace's transform to model systems (only ODEs) and solve them with no more than algebra. Learn why it works, and how it offers a framework or language to understand assembled systems such as the Mechanical Universe.",

That mathematical reasoning includes geometric analysis and empirical examples. An exact equation for the circumference of an ellipse has implications across disciplines where ellipses are encountered. The goal of the paper is to provide a clearer understanding of an ellipse’s circumference in accessible terms',

To solve this problem, we'll explore a mathematical technique I like to call the probability of states. This technique opens up a wide range of probability problems and will eventually take us to an introduction to Markov Chains, one of probabilities most useful tools.",
