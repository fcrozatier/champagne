# ü•Çüçæ Champagne ! üçæü•Ç

Bubble up the outstanding and celebrate the best!

## What is champagne?

Champagne is a voting platform for massive competitions. It implements the [NodeRank](https://github.com/fcrozatier/NodeRank) peer ranking algorithm where people vote by comparing pairs of entries to let the best ones bubble up the surface.

## How to use it?

You can use this project by setting a few environment variables in your local `.env` file:

- `PUBLIC_CURRENT_PHASE` _(number 0, 1, 2 or 3)_ is a semantic variable that allows to display information on the current state of the competition
- `PUBLIC_REGISTRATION_DEADLINE` _(string )_ An ISO 8601 string representing the registration deadline "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ"
- `PUBLIC_VOTING_OPEN`, `PUBLIC_RESULTS_OPEN` _(number 0 or 1)_ are three logic variables that give you granular control on which forms and widgets are actually live.

The decoupling between UI info and logic gives time for cleanup/maintenance between phases.
